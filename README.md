## Capstone
In this Capstone project, I analyze demographic data from Bertelsmann using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to gain insights and make predictions. The project consists of the following components:

## Unsupervised Learning Techniques
Customer Segmentation: I perform customer segmentation using unsupervised learning algorithms to group customers based on their demographic characteristics. This helps in identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company.
Supervised Learning Techniques
Conversion Prediction: I use supervised learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers. This allows the company to target their marketing efforts more effectively.
Files Used and Blog
The project is implemented in the 'Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb' file, which contains the analytical work and code. Additionally, I have shared a detailed report on Medium, which provides insights into the customer segmentation and conversion prediction analysis. You can find the report at the following link: [Medium Report](https://medium.com/@jessikram19/exploring-the-bertelsmann-arvato-project-workspace-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-data-science-f4343d17107d)

## Data
The analysis is based on several datasets provided by Bertelsmann, including demographics data for the general population of Germany, demographics data for customers of a mail-order company, demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign, and additional data files that provide attribute descriptions and data value mappings.

## Languages, Programs, and Libraries
The project is implemented using Python 3 programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Anaconda distribution is recommended for running the project.
